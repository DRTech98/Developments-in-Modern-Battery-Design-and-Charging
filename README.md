# Developments-in-Modern-Battery-Design-and-Charging
A project I did for my senior year of undergrad explaining how the history and origin of batteries. The project includes comparisons of different types of batteries and applications use, current and future developments of battery types and chargers, along with a teardown and reverse engineering of the PCB of a Nickel Metal Hydride/Nickel Cadmium battery charger. I took apart the charger and was able to determine the circuit layout used by recreating the layout in Pspice and simulating the circuit to obtain the values labeled on the back of the charger. Details of this project can be seen in the written and oral reports.
